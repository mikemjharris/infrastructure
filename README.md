## Infastructure project for mikemjharris

A load of bash scripts and stuff that helps my website work

- needs various git repos checked out - should be obvious from the deployment scripts.  Will make it a bit more codified sometime.

- needs https certs created.

These first few commits are just so i have stuff in source control as have had unique config sat on a server for ages with no backup.  Now i reckon I could get everything back and working in a few hours....
